# ImagingONEWORLD
Imaging ONEWORLD covers topics including sample preparation, labelling strategies, experimental workflows, and ‘how-to’ image and analyse. The webinars examine inspiring new scientific ideas and facilitate collaborations, with speakers also available for questions and answers. The organisers, core facility and research staff from the MRC-LMB, ICR/Royal Marsden Trust, Brunel University, University of Gothenburg, University of Jena and Cornell University, are also able to continue the discussion and provide advice on your imaging projects.
