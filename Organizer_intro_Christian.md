From 2006-2012, Christian studied physics at the University of Würzburg. Afterwards, he joined the group of Prof. Markus Sauer at the Biocenter Würzburg to do his
PhD work at the intersection of physics, biology and computer science. During his time at the Sauer Lab he mainly worked in methods development, both hard- and software,
for quantitative super-resolution (single-molecule) microscopy. In 2017 he finished his PhD work and started his Postdoctoral research at the Max Planck Institute of
Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics Dresden in the department of Prof. Marino Zerial. At MPI-CBG Christian was 'confronted' with complex biological questions regarding
the endosomal pathway and its nanoscale representation. Being previously a pure methods developer, now it was all about applying these powerful techniques ‘in the real 
world’. He developed workflows for correlative super-resolution and electron microscopy imaging of endosomal compartments to match the membrane ultrastructure obtained 
with EM with the specific nanoscopic localization of fluorescently labelled endosomal markers by dSTORM. Amongst others, his work contributed to the discovery of a novel
mechanism of cytosolic escape from endosomal recycling tubules and a first of its kind nanoscale study on the subcellular fate of mRNA, delivered by lipid nanoparticles.
In November 2020 he started his own lab as an Assistant Professor of Digitized Experimental Microscopy at the Institute of Applied Optics and Biophysics (IAOB) of the 
Friedrich Schiller University Jena.
Here, he and his team work to combine both the development of high-end tools for microscopy with their application in cell biology and clinical questions.
